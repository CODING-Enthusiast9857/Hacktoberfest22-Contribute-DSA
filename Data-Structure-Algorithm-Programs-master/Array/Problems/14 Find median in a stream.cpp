/*
Find median in a stream
Given an input stream of n integers the task is to insert integers to stream and print the median of the new stream formed by each insertion of x to the stream.

Example

Flow in stream : 5, 15, 1, 3 
5 goes to stream --> median 5 (5)
15 goes to stream --> median 10 (5, 15)
1 goes to stream --> median 5 (5, 15, 1)
3 goes to stream --> median 4 (5, 15, 1, 3)

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the no of elements of the stream. Then the next N lines contains integer x denoting the no to be inserted to the stream.

Output:
For each element added to the stream print the floor of the new median in a new line.

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^5+7
1<=x<=10^5+7
