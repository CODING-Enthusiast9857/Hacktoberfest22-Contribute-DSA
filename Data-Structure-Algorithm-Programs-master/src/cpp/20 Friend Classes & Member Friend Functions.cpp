/* 
Member Friend Functions in C++
Friend functions are those function which has access to private members of the class in which they are declared. The main thing to note here is that only that function 
can access the member function which is made friend of the other class. An example of a friend function is shown below.

Friend Classes in C++
Friend classes are those classes which have the permission to access private members of the class in which they are declared. The main thing to note here is that if the
class is made friend of another class then it can access all the private members of that class.
