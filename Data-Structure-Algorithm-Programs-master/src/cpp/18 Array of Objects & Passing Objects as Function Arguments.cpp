/* 
An array of objects is declared the same as any other data-type array.  An array of objects consists of class objects as its elements. 
If the array consists of class objects it is called an array of objects.

Passing Object as Function Argument
Objects can be passed as function arguments. This is useful when we want to assign the values of a passed object to the current object.
