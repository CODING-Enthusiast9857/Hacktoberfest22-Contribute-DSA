# STL Resources 

* In ***[STL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/)*** mainly we are having 
  1. Algorithm : ***Algorithm act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers***
  2. Containers : ***Containers or container classes store objects and data.***
  3. Functions : ***Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed.***
  4. Iterators : ***Iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values. They are the major feature that allow generality in STL.***

#### Algorithm:
1. [Sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-algorithms-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/) : sort(startaddress, endaddress)
2. [Searching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-algorithms-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/) : binary_search(startaddress,endaddress, valuetofind):- Returns : true if an element equal to valuetofind is found, else false.


3. [Important STL Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-magicians-stl-algorithms/)
  * sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.
  * reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.
  * max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
  * min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
  * accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements
  * count(first_iterator, last_iterator,x) – To count the occurrences of x in vector.
  * find(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – Returns an iterator to the first occurence of x in vector and points to last address of vector ((name_of_vector).end()) if element is not present in vector.
  * binary_search(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – Tests whether x exists in sorted vector or not.
  * lower_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range first,last) which has a value not less than ‘x’.
  * upper_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range first,last)which has a value greater than ‘x’.
