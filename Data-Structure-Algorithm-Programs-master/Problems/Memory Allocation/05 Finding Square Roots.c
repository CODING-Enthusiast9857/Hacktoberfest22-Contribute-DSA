/*
In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each T contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.
Output

For each line of input output the square root of the input integer.
Constraints

1<=T<=20
1<=N<=10000
TEST CASE 1

INPUT

5
10000
OUTPUT
3
2
